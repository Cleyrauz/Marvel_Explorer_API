# Marvel_Explorer_API

We would like you to develop a single-page search tool that will allow users to find on-demand information about specific characters in
the Marvel Universe.

-You can use any front-end framework and any component or style library. 

-Design isn't too important for this – we're interested in a usable, clean interface that shows off your
technical ability with HTML, CSS, Javascript and testing.

### Requirements
-The ability to search by character name and display the results.

-Choose a character from the search results and display their bio, the top 20 comics and top 10 events associated with them (the API docs will guide you here).

-The ability to close the search and start again.

-Show your commit history –we like to see how people work and apply a process.
